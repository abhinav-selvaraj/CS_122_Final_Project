CS122 Final Project

Project Title: Stock Market Analysis (Stockify) 

Authors: Abhinav Selvaraj, Carissa Lee

Description: 

Outline/Plan: 
  - Interface: The application will use the Tkinter library to create a GUI. The main page will show overall stock market trends, and multiple buttons and dropdowns will be available to change what is shown. For example, a button could change what sector of the market is   represented by the graph. 
  - Data Collection & Storage: Data will be collected using Polygon.io, a stock market API. Storage won't be necessary as the API provides access to both real-time and historical data
  - Data Analysis & Visualization: Stock data will be analyized and displayed in various charts and graphs. Furthermore, the application will be able to provide an analysis on seperate investment sectors as well as the market as a whole
