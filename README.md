Project Title: Stock Market Analysis (Stockify) 

Authors: Abhinav Selvaraj, Carissa Lee

Description: The Stock Market Analysis (Stockify) application includes a multi-window Python interface that will obtain, analyze, and visualize stock market data. It will allow users to select different viewing options of graphical stock market trends.

Outline/Plan: 
  - Interface: The application will use Flask to create a web interface. The main page will show overall stock market trends, and multiple buttons and dropdowns will be available to change what is shown. For example, a button could change what sector of the market is represented by the graph. 
  - Data Collection & Storage: Data will be collected using Alpha Vantage, a free stock market API. Storage won't be necessary as the API provides access to real-time and historical data.
  - Data Analysis & Visualization: Stock data showing growth or loss will be analyzed and displayed in various charts and graphs. Furthermore, the application will be able to provide an analysis on separate investment sectors as well as the market as a whole. The visualization will include plotting trends of the stock market, utilizing Python's numpy package.
